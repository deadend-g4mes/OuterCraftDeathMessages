# OuterCraftDeathMessages
Adds funny death messages to Outer Wilds. At the moment, only displays in the OWML log.

# Roadmap
- [ ] Displaying text after fade to black and removing text before nomai mask appears.
- [ ] Making code modular for mods to add their own custom messages and deaths.
- [ ] Adding Achievement+ mod integration with achievements for each death type (and getting all death types).
- [ ] Extra code for checking difference between base game death types (e.g. DeathType Asphixiation being for both drowning and space walking without your suit. Will add checks for if the player was in water before asphyxiation).
