# OuterCraftDeathMessages
Adds funny death messages to Outer Wilds. At the moment, only displays in the OWML log.

# Roadmap
- Displaying text after fade to black and removing text before nomai mask appears.
- Making code modular for mods to add their own custom messages and deaths.
- Adding Achievement+ mod integration with achievements for each death type (and getting all death types).
